                  Simple calculator 
This is a simple calculator that works basic arthimetic operations and BMI by reciving input from the user. I used prompt to accept numbers from the user
The first 4 functions do the basic arthimetic opertaions Then there is a BMI calculator, the main menu and the function to recive
inputs, choice operator and finally the main function.
The biggest challange i have faced is using the prompt-sync library. I havent tried to use node.js to work on console apps
so i didnt know how to recive inputs. I serched the issuse and i have got solution.
