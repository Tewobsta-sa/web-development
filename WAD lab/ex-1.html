    <h2>What is Html5?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
        It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current 
        specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), 
        a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft). HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form 
        on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language 
        with support for the latest multimedia and new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently 
        understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.; without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible 
        with older software.
