I began my journey as a full-stack web developer by learning the basics through FreeCodeCamp's website. After mastering the fundamentals, I took a significant step forward by cloning existing websites. This practice greatly increased my skills and confidence.
Encouraged by this progress, I then started creating my own projects. During this phase, the following resources were particularly helpful and I recommend them to you as well:
